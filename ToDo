-Find a way to stop Starman if it fails to start. Currently, it falls into an endless
loop and creates large error files if it fails to compile/start.

-Make sure to start a crontab to clean old session data. See README for the current crontab
which is set MANUALLY.

-Add a column to the role table to associate each role with a directory name
this will make sure that role names are not exposed in the JNLP argument string

-We assume that each user can have a single role. If a user has multiple roles, 
the current app will not work as expected (directory hierarchy is based on 
single roles). The problem is .crunch files, which are generated for genomes of
a single role. Having multiple roles would imply creating many more crunch files (more 
combinations of comparisons possible).
If users request more than one role in future, this problem  will need to be fixed! 
(Create the crunch files on the fly? => more processing, complex and CPU intensive)

-(Low priority) Make sure role based directories are not accessible to people 
not assigned to the role
