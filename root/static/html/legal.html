    <h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
    <p>
      Customisation of this website requires that our server can identify the computer and web browser that requests data over a
      period of time. To do this, a small file is saved on the user's computer. This file contains no personal data, only an
      encrypted numeric identifier. Visitors' page settings are stored in a user database against this identifier, making it
      possible for us to save your settings without storing any other information about you.
    </p>
    <h3>Additional information held in user accounts</h3>
    <p>
      Of necessity, all user accounts are accessible to the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute web database administrators. However
      passwords are stored in one-way encrypted format and cannot be retrieved by these administrators. This does not affect your
      statutory rights.
