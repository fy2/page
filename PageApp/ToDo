    -add a column to the role table to associate each role with a directory name
     this will make sure that role names are not exposed in the JNLP argument string

    -develop a method to associate non-analysed lane_ids with the user roles.

    -make sure role based directories are not accessible to people not assigned to the role

    -create javascript form check on artemis/act genome selection pages

    -in current version, we make the assumption that each user can have a single role. 
     If a user gets multiple roles, the current app will not work as expected (directory hierarchy
     is based on single roles). 
     If users request more than one role in future, this will need to be fixed!
