#this is where we store the datasets specific to each "role" in
#role table. the user role directories must have the same name 
#as the role name. The subdirs of these have a sytematic name hierarchy
#Currently, "annotation" and "crunch" sub dirs are available
data:
    #.gz files are served from this root path
    # (web URL comes as prefix automaticall)
    root: /static/page/genomes

    #where do the embl files for artemis reside?
    dir_name_of_annotation: annotation

    #This is just the suffix after the file name
    #we assume files are named with sanger lane ID (e.g. "1234_5#6.embl") 
    #and EMBL suffix  (e.g. "1234_5#6.embl")
    file_extension_of_annotation: .embl.gz
    
    #Crunch file handling is similar to EMBL, but now we deal with file names,
    #made up of two parts (crunch is a pairwise comparison file for two organims).
    #If we have two organism, and name them according to sanger lane is,
    #e.g. "1234_5#6 and "6543_2#1". When generating crunch files we should always 
    #sort the names alphabetically and added a .crunch suffix to them, 
    #i.e. "file1.file2.crunch".
