#this is where we store the datasets specific to each "role" in
#role table. the user role directories must have the same name 
#as the role name. The subdirs of these have a sytematic name hierarchy
#Currently, "annotation" and "crunch" sub dirs are available

    #This is just the suffix after the file name

    #Crunch file handling is similar to EMBL, but now we deal with file names,
    #made up of two parts (crunch is a pairwise comparison file for two organims).
    #If we have two organism, and name them according to sanger lane is,
    #e.g. "1234_5#6 and "6543_2#1". When generating crunch files we should always 
    #sort the names alphabetically and added a .crunch suffix to them, 
    #i.e. "file1.file2.crunch".
