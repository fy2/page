#This is where we store the datasets specific to each DB "role". 
#The user role directories must have the same name  as the role name. 
#The subdirs of these have a systematic name hierarchy.
#Currently, "annotation" and "crunch" sub dirs are available
data:

    #Where do the embl files for artemis reside?
    dir_name_of_annotation: annotation

    #This is just the suffix after the file name.
    #The file is gzipped to save bandwidth (e.g. "1234_5#6.embl.gz")
    file_extension_of_annotation: .embl.gz
    
    #Crunch file handling is similar to EMBL, but now we deal with file names,
    #made up of two parts (crunch is a pairwise comparison file for two organims).
    #When generating crunch files we should always sort the names alphabetically 
    #and add a .crunch suffix to them, preferably gzip them to save bandwidth. 
    #i.e. "organismA.organismB.crunch.gz".
    dir_name_of_crunch: crunch
    file_extension_of_crunch: .crunch.gz
